# Rl_UB_project
The fruit of my 2016 summer internship! To be used with rllab (https://github.com/rllab/rllab), specifically the ddpg algorithm. Many of the programs here are just the rllab contributors' but with a few edits.
<p> Here were my files' locations when I worked with the rllab project directory ("home directory" refers to just inside the rllab project folder):</p>
<ol>
  <li> UB_env.py: /rllab/envs/box2d/
  <li> box2d_env_ub.py: /rllab/envs/box2d/
  <li> UBSpace.py: /rllab/spaces/
  <li> UB.xml.mako: /rllab/envs/box2d/models/
  <li> normalized_env_ub.py: /rllab/envs/
  <li> ddpg_UB.py: home directory
  <li> ddpg_alg_ub.py: /rllab/algos/
  <li> UB_Generator.py: home directory
  <li> utils.py: /rllab/sampler
  <li> Data folder: home directory
</ol>
<p> Note that this work is very much in progress. Thank you for your cooperation. </p>
