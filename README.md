# Rl_UB_project
The fruit of my 2016 summer internship! To be used with rllab (https://github.com/rllab/rllab), specifically the ddpg algorithm. Many of the programs here are just the rllab contributors' but with a few edits.
<p> Here were my files' locations when I worked with the rllab project directory:</p>
<ol>
  <li> UB_env.py: /rllab/envs/box2d
  <li> More
</ol>
<p> Note that this work is very much in progress. Thank you for your cooperation. </p>
